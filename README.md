# Motor position control Aurora 309C using Spike2
In the document [manual.pdf](https://github.com/edwinreuvers/control-aurora-motor/blob/main/manual.pdf) I have outlined my software for controlling the Aurora 309C motor position using Spike2. This document outlines the development process of the software, with the aim of providing insight into its structure and functionality, thereby facilitating its use and potential modification. Additionally, the *exp* folder contains various example scripts (i.e., script to run quick-release and step-ramp experiments as well as stretch-shortening cycles).
